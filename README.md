ðŸ˜„ðŸ˜„ Hi Visitors,

My name is Tianhao Zhang and I am currently enrolled in CMU AI Master program. I am actively looking for US-based 2024 summer internship in software, machine learning, artificial intelligence, data science, computational materials science, semiconductor modeling, etc. My career interest is wide-ranging, from fundamental semiconductor device physics to electrical firmware/hardware design to software/algorithm design and data analysis. I am fascinated by miniaturized micro/nano-scale chip and nano-materials as well as associated large-scale micro-fabrication equipment and robot. My long-term career goal is targeted at applying state-of-the-art AI technologies to address challenging issues in a wide spectrum of engineering application fields.
